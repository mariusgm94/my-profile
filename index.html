	 			<h2>What is Bluetrip ?</h2>
	 			<p>Bluetrip is a platform that offers its users engaged travel. What is an engaged trip? It is an experience where you, the volunteers, go abroad to help an association while visiting the city/region of your choice. It means participating in local life in your own way by becoming a part-time volunteer during your vacation.</p>

	 			<h2>A new experience<h2>
	 			<p>Proposing a glossary of associations would not be enough and would be like an associative site that would make the link between the needs of associations and volunteers. This is why, in addition to focusing on the needs of associations and the missions they offer, BlueTrip offers its users the possibility to book accommodation nearby and, in the long run, will host a flight comparator such as Skyscanner. Depending on the destination chosen, the dates, the duration of the trip and the number of people, the platform will be able to propose a list of associations corresponding to the search filters. The aim is to make life easier for users by offering a turnkey solution.</p>
